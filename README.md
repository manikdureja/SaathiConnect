## üìñ Overview

**SaathiConnect** (meaning "Companion Connect") is a comprehensive web platform designed to support senior citizens by providing a digital ecosystem for their health and social needs. It bridges the gap between patients, doctors, and hospitals, ensuring that vital medical information is accessible when it matters most, while also fostering a sense of community.

This project is built with the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js) and is deployed on Render.

## ‚ú® Key Features
